# Equipment

## Overview

The `Equipment` entity represents an actual piece of equipment within a factory or manufacturing environment. While
`EquipmentClass` defines categories like "Forklift" or "Saw," the `Equipment` entity models individual instances of
those categories, such as a specific forklift used on a production line. This allows tracking of each piece of equipment
independently for operational, maintenance, and reporting purposes.

## Table Structure

The following table outlines the SQL columns for the `equipment` table, providing a brief description of each, along
with sample data where applicable.
