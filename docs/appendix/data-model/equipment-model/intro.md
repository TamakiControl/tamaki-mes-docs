# Equipment Model Overview

The **Equipment** model in **TamakiMES** is designed to manage all aspects of physical assets within a manufacturing
environment. It enables tracking, categorizing, and maintaining equipment, ensuring that each piece is effectively
monitored and available for production activities.

### 1. EquipmentClass

Defines categories of equipment (e.g., Forklift, Pump), allowing similar types of equipment to be
grouped for streamlined management, reporting, and scheduling. Equipment Classes also store common properties that
apply to all equipment within that category.

### 2. Equipment

Represents individual instances of equipment within the facility. Each equipment item is linked to an
Equipment Class, inheriting standard properties, while also maintaining unique data specific to that item (e.g., 
location, status). This provides a clear structure for managing both individual items and groups of similar assets.

### 3. EquipmentProperty

Defines the attributes that are common across all items within an Equipment Class, such as "Horsepower" for motors 
or "Capacity" for tanks. This enables standardized property definitions for each category of equipment.

### 4. EquipmentPropertyValue

Stores specific values for each property at the individual equipment level, allowing customization per item. 
This ensures that each piece of equipment can be configured and tracked based on its unique specifications.

### 5. EquipmentMaintenanceOrder

Tracks maintenance tasks for equipment, including scheduling and status updates. Maintenance Orders help 
ensure that equipment remains in optimal condition, with logs for planned and completed maintenance activities.

### 6. EquipmentMaintenancePlan

Establishes recurring or triggered maintenance schedules for equipment, ensuring proactive upkeep. Maintenance 
Plans can automatically generate Maintenance Orders based on predefined triggers or schedules.

The **Equipment** model in **TamakiMES** allows for comprehensive management of physical assets, from categorizing
equipment types to tracking individual items, maintenance, and documentation. This structure ensures that each piece of
equipment is accurately monitored, maintained, and documented, supporting operational efficiency and asset longevity.

This high-level overview provides a clear picture of how the **Equipment** model functions within TamakiMES, without
delving into field-level details. Each component has a specific purpose, contributing to a complete and organized asset
management system.
