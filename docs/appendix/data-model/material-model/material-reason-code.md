# Material Reason Code

## Overview

The `MaterialReasonCode` entity represents standardized codes used for categorizing specific reasons associated with
material handling activities, such as scrapping, merging, or consumption. These codes aid in providing consistent
documentation and tracking for various material-related processes, enabling better reporting and analysis.

## Table Structure

The following table outlines the SQL columns for the `material_reason_codes` table, providing a brief description of
each, along with sample data where applicable.

## Field Details

### `lot_record_type`

Defines the action that was taken on a lot, specified by the **LotRecordType** enum, which includes options such as
`CONSUME`, `PRODUCE`, `MOVE`, `SPLIT`, `MERGE`, `SCRAP`, `STATUS_CHANGE`, `EDIT`, `RECEIVE`, and `SHIP`. This helps categorize material actions.

### `reason_code`

A unique code that identifies the reason associated with the material handling process. This code enables standardized
reference for common reasons across operations.

### `description`

An optional field that provides a detailed description of the reason codeâ€™s purpose or application, allowing users to
add more context to the selected reason.

### `require_comments`

Specifies if additional comments are required when selecting this reason code, which helps in capturing additional
context or justification during the material handling process.
