# Operation Model Overview

The **Operation** model organizes and manages data related to tasks and processes performed within the MES system, supporting 
functions like scheduling, execution, and tracking of operations. This model consists of the following primary entities:

---

### 1. Operation

Defines the tasks or actions that can be performed, including their parameters, triggers, and execution strategies. 
This entity supports efficient planning and management of operations within the system.

### 2. Operation Record

Represents instances of operations performed, recording key details such as timing, location, and status. 
This entity provides a history of operations to support tracking, analysis, and process improvement.

### 3. MaterialInventory

Represents the interaction between operations and materials, including actions on material lots, inventory handling, 
and quantity management. It ensures accurate tracking and alignment of materials with operational processes.

Each entity in this model supports specific tasks related to the planning, execution, and tracking of operations, enhancing 
the overall efficiency and management of workflows within the system. The **Operation** model integrates closely with material 
handling, scheduling, and production processes, enabling seamless coordination and control across the manufacturing lifecycle.
