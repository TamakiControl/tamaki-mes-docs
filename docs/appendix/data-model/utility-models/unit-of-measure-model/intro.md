# Unit Of Measure Model Overview

The **UnitOfMeasure** model organizes and manages measurement definitions within the system, facilitating
accurate conversions between different units. This model consists of the following primary entities:

---

### 1. UnitOfMeasure

Defines specific measurement definitions within the system used to quantify and
contextualize values for materials.

### 2. UnitOfMeasureConversion

Represents the conversion between two different **UnitOfMeasure** entities. The conversion between
different units is by a conversion factor, which is typically a multiplicative factor.

The **UnitOfMeasure** model provides a robust framework for organizing, managing and contextualizing
measurement definitions within the system, whilst also providing conversions between different units.
