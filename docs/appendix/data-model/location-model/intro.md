# Location Model Overview

The **Location** model in _TamakiMES_ is designed to represent the hierarchical structure and characteristics of
physical locations within a manufacturing environment. Each location can be a part of a larger organizational structure,
support specific types of processes, and include attributes like storage capabilities, inventory strategies, and maximum
capacities.

company structures down to specific production units.

### 2. location_properties

Defines a property that can apply to multiple locations, such as "Temperature Control" or "Storage Type."

### 3. location_property_values

Stores the actual values of properties for specific locations, allowing each location to have unique characteristics
based on its configuration.
