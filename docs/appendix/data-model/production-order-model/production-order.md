# Production Order

## Overview

The `ProductionOrder` entity manages information related to each production order, including product details,
scheduling, customer information, and production quantities. This table enables efficient tracking and organization of
production orders within the TamakiMES system.

## Table Structure

The following table outlines the SQL columns for the `production_orders` table, providing a brief description of each, along
with sample data where applicable.

## Field Details

### `name`

The `name` field provides a descriptive identifier for the production order.

### `start_date`, `due_date`, `end_date`

- **start_date**: Timestamp indicating when the production started.
- **due_date**: Timestamp indicating the expected completion date for the production order.
- **end_date**: Timestamp indicating when the production was completed.

These timestamps provide temporal context for each production order.

### `quantity`, `quantity_produced`, `quantity_scheduled`

- **quantity**: The quantity of units planned for production.
- **quantity_produced**: The quantity of units already produced for this production order.
- **quantity_scheduled**: The quantity of units scheduled for production.

These quantities provide metrics about the progress of the production order.

### `schedule_priority`

Represents the priority of this production order, as defined by the **SchedulePriority** enum,
with options such as `LOW`, `NORMAL`, `HIGH`, and `URGENT`.

### `status`

Represents the running status of the production order, as defined by the **ProductionOrderStatus** enum, with options such as
`IDLE`, `SCHEDULED`, `RUNNING`, `PAUSED`, `STOPPED`, `CLOSED`, and `CANCELLED`.

### `location_id`

References the `Location` entity where this production order is taking place, allowing precise tracking of where
this production order is within the facility.
See [locations](../location-model/location) for details.

### `product_material_id`

References the `Material` entity associated with the production order, providing context about the material's characteristics and
properties.
See [materials](../material-model/material) for details.

### `customer_id`

References the `ProductionOrderCustomer` entity associated with the production order, providing us information on the customer.
See [production_order_customers](../production-order-model/production-order-customer) for details.

### `unit_of_measure_id`

References the unit of measure applicable to this material, such as kilograms or liters, supporting precise tracking of quantities.
See [unit_of_measure](../utility-models/unit-of-measure-model/unit-of-measure) for details.
