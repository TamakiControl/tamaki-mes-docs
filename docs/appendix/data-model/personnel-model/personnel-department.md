## Field Details

### `parent_id`

References the parent `PersonnelDepartment`, allowing departments to be organized in a hierarchical structure.
This structure enables modeling departments from high-level divisions down to specialized units.

### `name`

The `name` field provides a descriptive identifier for the department, such as "Engineering" or "Finance." This field
must be unique within the scope of its parent department.

### `description`

An optional field that provides additional context for the department's function or scope. This can support clarity
around the department's responsibilities within the organization.

### `path`

The `path` is a unique identifier for the department, generated automatically based on the hierarchical structure. It
reflects the department's place within the organization, enabling easier navigation and reporting.

## Hierarchical Structure

The `PersonnelDepartment` supports a hierarchical structure, allowing for nested departments. The `computePath` method
generates a unique path for each department based on its name and hierarchy, providing an easy-to-read representation of
the departmentâ€™s location within the organization.

For example, a path like `/Corporate/Engineering` indicates that "Engineering" is a sub-department under "Corporate."
