# system.mes.oee.getDowntimeStatistics

Calculates comprehensive downtime statistics for a specific location within a date range.

## Permissions

This method requires the `OEE.READ.GET` permission.

## Syntax

```python
system.mes.oee.getDowntimeStatistics(locationIdOrPath, startDate, endDate=None)
```

## Parameters

| Parameter          | Type     | Nullable | Description                                                        |
| ------------------ | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `locationIdOrPath` | `String` | False    | The ULID or path of the location to calculate statistics for.      |
| `startDate`        | `Date`   | False    | The start date for the calculation period.                         |
| `endDate`          | `Date`   | True     | The end date for the calculation period. Defaults to current time. |

## Returns

An `OeeDowntimeStatisticsDTO` object containing comprehensive downtime statistics.

## Code Examples

```python
from java.util import Date
from java.util.concurrent import TimeUnit

# Calculate downtime statistics for the last 24 hours
location_path = "Enterprise/Site/Area/Line1"
end_date = Date()
start_date = Date(end_date.getTime() - TimeUnit.HOURS.toMillis(24))

downtime_stats = system.mes.oee.getDowntimeStatistics(location_path, start_date, end_date)

print "Downtime Events:", downtime_stats.downtimeEventCount
print "MTBF (sec):", downtime_stats.meanTimeBetweenFailuresSec
print "MTTR (sec):", downtime_stats.meanTimeToRepairSec
```
