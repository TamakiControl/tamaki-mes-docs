# system.mes.oee.acknowledgeStateRecord

Acknowledges a specific OEE state record, marking it as reviewed and accepted.

## Permissions

This method requires the `OEE.WRITE.SAVE` permission.

## Syntax

```python
system.mes.oee.acknowledgeStateRecord(oeeStateRecordId)
```

## Parameters

| Parameter          | Type            | Nullable | Description                                      |
| ------------------ | --------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `oeeStateRecordId` | `String` (ULID) | False    | The ULID of the OEE state record to acknowledge. |
