## Code Examples

```python
# Generate the object structure for a new receive request object with no initial arguments
newRequest = system.mes.inventory.newReceiveRequest()

# Set basic attributes for the new receive request
newRequest['materialIdOrPath'] = 'Bottle/Milk'
newRequest['destinationLocationIdOrPath'] = 'DairyCo'
newRequest['quantity'] = 610
newRequest['createIfNotExists'] = True
# (You can continue setting other properties as needed here)

# Receive the inventory
receiptLotRecord = system.mes.inventory.receive(**newRequest)

# Output the JSON representation of the lot record of the receipt
print(receiptLotRecord)
```
