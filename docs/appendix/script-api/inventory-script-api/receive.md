## Returns

Returns a JSON representation of an inventory lot record for a Receive Request.

## Code Examples

```python
# Generate the object structure for a new receive request object with no initial arguments
new_request = system.mes.inventory.newReceiveRequest()

# Set basic attributes for the new receive request
new_request['materialIdOrPath'] = 'Bottle/Milk'
new_request['destinationLocationIdOrPath'] = 'DairyCo'
new_request['quantity'] = 610
new_request['createIfNotExists'] = True
# (You can continue setting other properties as needed here)

# Receive the request
received_request = system.mes.inventory.receive(**new_request)

# Output the JSON representation of the received request
print(received_request)
```
