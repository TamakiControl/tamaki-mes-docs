## Code Examples

```python
# Generate the object structure for a new merge request object with no initial arguments
newRequest = system.mes.inventory.newMergeRequest()

# Set basic attributes for the new merge request
newRequest['sourceLotId'] = '01JJD0ST06-APPRGRCY-25ZQ49FR'
newRequest['destinationLotId'] = '01JJCPQWYG-T9CW4G6Z-96XBWYQB'
# (You can continue setting other properties as needed here)

# Merge the lots
mergeLotRecord = system.mes.inventory.merge(**newRequest)

# Output the JSON representation of the lot record of the merger
print(mergeLotRecord)
```
