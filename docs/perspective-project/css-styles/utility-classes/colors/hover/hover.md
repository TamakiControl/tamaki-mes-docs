## Overview

Every background color and text color class in the project has a hover variant that can be used to change the color of the element when the user hovers over it. This can be useful for creating interactive elements that change color when the user interacts with them.

For example, the `bg-primary` class can be used to set the background color of an element to the primary color, and the `hover-bg-primary` class can be used to change the background color of the element to the primary color when the user hovers over it. Furthermore, the `text-primary` class can be used to set the text color of an element to the primary color, and the `hover-text-primary` class can be used to change the text color of the element to the primary color when the user hovers over it.

## Additional Hover Classes
