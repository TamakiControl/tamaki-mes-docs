# Widgets User Guide

Widgets are individual components that can be added to [custom dashboards](dashboard.md) to display or control live 
data in various formats. Under the hood, a widget can be any ignition perspective view. Tamaki MES provides a set of 
pre-configured widgets to be used out-of-the-box, but users can also create their own custom widgets.

## Creating Custom Widgets

To create a custom widget, you will first need a perspective view that you want to use as the widget. Open your 
MES perspective project in the Ignition Designer and create a new view or use an existing one. Make note of the 
path and the parameters of the view, as you will need this information when creating the widget.

To navigate to the widget configuration screen, go to the MES Perspective project and select `Core` â†’ `Widgets` from
the navigation menu at the top of the screen.

When no widget is selected the main view of the widget configuration screen has buttons to create, import, and export 
widgets. On the left side of the screen is a sidebar that contains a list of all existing widgets. The search bar
can be used to quickly locate a specific widget by name. 

To create a new widget, click the `Create` button if no widget is selected or right click in the sidebar and select 
`Add Widget`. The main view will change to the Create New Widget form. Here is a breakdown of the fields in the form:

- **View Path**: The path to the perspective view that will be embedded in the widget. This is a required field and
