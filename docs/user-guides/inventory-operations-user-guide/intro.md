# Inventory Operation User Guide
[Inventory Operations](..%2F..%2Fappendix%2Fdata-model%2Finventory-operation-model%2Finventory-operation.md) are definitions of actions that can be performed on inventory items within the MES system. These operations help manage and track the movement, transformation, and usage of inventory throughout the manufacturing process. They can be managed using expressions and tags or manually using the [Scripting API](..%2F..%2Fappendix%2Fscript-api%2Finventory-operation-script-api%2Fintro.md). Any time an inventory operation is performed, an [Inventory Lot Record](..%2F..%2Fappendix%2Fdata-model%2Finventory-operation-model%2Finventory-lot-record.md) is created to log the details of the inventory operation.
