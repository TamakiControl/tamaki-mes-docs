# Terms and Definitions
This document provides definitions and explanations of key terms related to Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) in manufacturing. Understanding these terms is essential for effectively utilizing OEE metrics to improve production processes.

## OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness)
- **Definition:** 
  - A measure of how effectively a manufacturing operation is utilized compared to its full potential.
- **Formula**:
```
    OEE = (Availability) x (Performance) x (Quality)
```
- **Components:**
  - [Availability](#availability): The percentage of scheduled time that the equipment is available for production.
  - [Performance](#performance): The speed at which the equipment operates compared to its maximum potential speed.
  - [Quality](#quality): The percentage of products produced that meet quality standards.
- **Purpose:**
  - **Identifies Inefficiencies**: OEE helps pinpoint areas where production processes can be improved, leading to increased efficiency.
  - **Enhances Decision-Making**: By providing real-time data on equipment performance, OEE supports informed decision-making for process improvements.
  - **Drives Continuous Improvement**: OEE encourages a culture of continuous improvement by highlighting performance gaps and tracking progress over time.

## State
- **Definition:** 
  - The current operational status of a piece of equipment or production line.
- **Purpose:**
  - To indicate whether the equipment is running, stopped, or in a fault condition.

## Mode
- **Definition:** 
  - The operational mode of a piece of equipment, such as running, setup, maintenance, or idle.
- **Purpose:**
  - To categorize the operational state of equipment based on its current function or activity.

## Availability
- **Definition:** 
  - The percentage of scheduled time that the equipment is available for production.
  - It accounts for downtime due to maintenance, breakdowns, and other interruptions.
- **Formula**:
```
    Availability = (Total Production Time - Downtime) / Total Production Time
```
- **Purpose**:
  - To measure the effectiveness of equipment utilization by identifying periods when it is not available for production.

## Performance
- **Definition:** 
  - The speed at which the equipment operates compared to its maximum potential speed.
  - It identifies losses due to slow cycles or reduced speed.
- **Formula**:
```
    Performance = (Actual Production Rate / Ideal Production Rate)
```
- **Purpose**:
  - To assess how efficiently the equipment is operating relative to its designed capacity.

## Quality
- **Definition:** 
  - The percentage of products produced that meet quality standards.
  - It identifies defects and rework, impacting overall production efficiency.
- **Formula**:
```
    Quality = (Good Units Produced / Total Units Produced)
```
- **Purpose**:
  - To evaluate the effectiveness of the production process in delivering products that meet quality requirements.
