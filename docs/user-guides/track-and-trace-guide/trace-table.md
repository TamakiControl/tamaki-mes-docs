The Table View can be accessed from the Track and Trace Graph View by clicking the "Table View" tab located at the top of the screen. This view displays a list of inventory transactions/records related to the selected lot, including details such as source/destination lots, quantities, dates, and transaction types. The Table View allows users to export the displayed data to a CSV file for further analysis or reporting purposes. To export the data, simply click the "Export" button located above the table, and the system will generate a downloadable CSV file containing the current view's data.
